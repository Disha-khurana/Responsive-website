        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills,
             and character traits and manifests in various forms. Formal education occurs within
              a structured institutional framework, 
            such as public schools, following a curriculum. Non-formal education also follows a 
            structured approach but occurs outside the formal schooling system,
             while informal education entails unstructured learning through daily experiences.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education can be characterized from both the teacher's
             and the student's perspectives. Teacher-centered definitions emphasize the perspective and
              role of the teacher in transmitting knowledge and skills in a morally appropriate manner.
              On the other hand, student-centered definitions analyze education based on the student's 
              involvement in the learning process, suggesting that this process transforms and 
              enriches their subsequent experiences. It's also possible to consider definitions that incorporate both perspectives. In this approach, education is seen as a process of shared experience, 
            involving the discovery of a common world and the collaborative solving of problems</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Various scholars emphasize the importance of critical thinking 
            in distinguishing education from indoctrination. They argue that indoctrination focuses 
            solely on instilling beliefs in students, regardless of their rationality;
             whereas education also encourages the rational ability to critically examine and question 
             those beliefs. However, it is not universally accepted that these two phenomena
              can be clearly distinguished, as some forms of indoctrination may be necessary in the early 
              stages of education when the child's mind is not yet fully developed. 
              This is particularly relevant in cases where young children must learn certain things
               without comprehending the underlying reasons, 
            such as specific safety rules and hygiene practices.</p>
